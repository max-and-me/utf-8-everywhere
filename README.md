# String Convert

## Motivation

Only for Windows! Whenever you pass strings into the Windows API you need to convert them from UTF-8 to UTF-16. Solution is inspired by a [stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/69410299).

## Getting started

### Clone and Build

```sh
git clone ...
mkdir ...
cd ..
cmake ../
```
